# Cat Shelter Workshop NodeJS

## Project Description

"Cat Shelter" is a very simple cat catalog that shows the "database" (JSON file) of some cat shelter and everyone (registration is not required) user can be their potential owner. The application will consist of the basic CRUD operations (Create cat, Read cat, Update cat and Delete cat). Each cat has a name, description, image and breed.

## Functionality

-   ### Add Cat Breed
    -   Create cat breed which later can be picked when a new cat is added to the shelter
-   ### Add Cat
    -   Create a new cat, which has a name, description, image and breed
    -   All cats must be saved in a JSON file (that will be our database)
-   ### List All Cats
    -   List all cats from the "database" no matter the breed
-   ### Edit Cat
    -   Edits cat's information. Changes must be persisted in "database"
-   ### Delete Cat
    -   Deletes specific cat from database. Changes must be persisted in "database"
-   ### Search Cat
